/*
OpenMetadata Apis

# Overview  OpenMetadata supports REST APIs for getting metadata in and out of metadata store. The API resources are grouped under following categories: - **Data assets** - includes resources for data entities, such as `databases`, `tables`, and `topics`. Resources for data assets created from data, such as `dashboards`, `reports`, `metrics`, and `ML Features` are part of this collection. `pipelines`, `notebooks`, etc. that are used for creating data assets are also available as resources as of this collection. - **Teams and Users** - includes `users`, `teams`, a special type of user called `bots` that performs many automated tasks such as ingestion. - **Services** - are services that OpenMetadata integrates with. Currently `databaseService` is the only service under this collection that represents data sources. In the future, services related to Dashboards, Reports, ETL pipelines will be added under this collection. - **Glossary** - OpenMetadata supports hierarchical tags that can be used to build business vocabulary to describe and classify data available under `tags` resource.
